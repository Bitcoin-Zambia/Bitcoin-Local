# Contributing to Bitcoin Local Languages – Zambia

Thank you for your interest in helping make Bitcoin education accessible in Zambia's local languages! Here's how you can contribute:

## Ways to Contribute

- Translate existing documents into Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, or other Zambian languages.
- Review translations for clarity, accuracy, and cultural relevance.
- Suggest additional educational materials that would benefit from localization.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a folder under `/translations/` with the name of the language if it doesn’t already exist.
3. Add or edit the translated document(s) in that folder.
4. Commit your changes with a clear message (e.g., "Translated Bitcoin Basics into Bemba").
5. Submit a pull request (PR).

## Guidelines

- Try to keep technical terms consistent across languages. Add footnotes or a glossary if needed.
- Be mindful of tone and cultural context — make the content approachable and easy to understand.
- Feel free to add voice notes or audio files to help with pronunciation and oral sharing.

If you're unsure where to start, reach out by opening an issue in the repo or connect with us via [Bitcoin Zambia](https://twitter.com/BitcoinZambia).

Let’s make Bitcoin education accessible to every Zambian, in every language!
