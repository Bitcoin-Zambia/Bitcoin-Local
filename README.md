# Bitcoin-Local
Bitcoin Local is translations of Bitcoin educational materials into Zambia’s local languages. A community-driven effort to make Bitcoin knowledge accessible across Zambia by translating key resources into Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, and other local languages.

This project aims to break language barriers by translating essential Bitcoin education materials into Zambia’s local languages. We believe access to Bitcoin knowledge should not be limited by language, and this repository supports community collaboration to localize high-quality content for broader understanding and inclusion.

Goals:

- Translate core Bitcoin learning materials into major Zambian languages (Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, etc.)
- Provide free, open-source educational content in formats accessible to local communities
- Support community reviewers to ensure linguistic and cultural accuracy
- Encourage adoption and understanding of Bitcoin through language inclusivity
